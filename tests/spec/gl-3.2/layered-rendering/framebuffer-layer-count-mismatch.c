 * ARB_geometry_shader4 doesn't permit layered framebuffers to have
 * mismatched layer counts.  From ARB_geometry_shader4, under the
 * heading "add to the list of conditions necessary for completeness":
 *
 *     * If any framebuffer attachment is layered, all attachments
 *       must have the same layer count.  For three-dimensional
 *       textures, the layer count is the depth of the attached
 *       volume.  For cube map textures, the layer count is always
 *       six.  For one- and two-dimensional array textures, the layer
 *       count is simply the number of layers in the array texture.
 *       { FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_LAYER_COUNT_ARB }
 *
 * However, this restriction was lifted when geometry shaders were
 * adopted into OpenGL 3.2.  Instead, OpenGL 3.2 states, in section
 * 4.4.7 (Layered Framebuffers):
 *
 *     When fragments are written to a layered framebuffer, the
 *     fragment’s layer number selects an image from the array of
 *     images at each attachment point to use for the stencil test
 *     (see section 4.1.5), depth buffer test (see section 4.1.6), and
 *     for blending and color buffer writes (see section 4.1.8).  If
 *     the fragment’s layer number is negative, or greater than the
 *     minimum number of layers of any attachment, the effects of the
 *     fragment on the framebuffer contents are undefined.
 *
 * This test verifies that a framebuffer is considered complete even
 * if two different attachments have different layer counts.
